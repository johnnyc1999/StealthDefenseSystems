						<h2>Mike McNamara,</br>10th Degree Black Belt</h2>
						<blockquote>"I have known John Castaldo for almost fifty
								years. John was a competitor in karate events from the beginning of the
								sport through “the golden age of karate”. John was considered then one of
								the “superstars” of his era and ranked in the top ten fighters in the
								country. When he retired he became an excellent instructor and his
								students followed in his competitive footsteps. Having fought several of
								his students I am well aware of his excellence as an instructor. I would
								have no qualms in recommending John as a well talented and compassionate
								teacher. If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to contact me @
								708-473-0682."

						<h2>Pete Hoffman, </br>
						Co-Director, Illinois Martial Arts Hall of Fame</h2>
						<blockquote>"As the Co-
								director of the Illinois Martial Arts Hall of Fame, I get to meet some of
								the finest martial artists in the world. John Castaldo stands out as one
								of the IMAHF’s greatest inductees. John’s well-earned reputation as the
								perennial champion and one of the best karate fighters of his era is
								actually overshadowed by his technical excellence and his abilities as a
								teacher. As a school owner, John trained countless students who began
								with a wide range of natural abilities and he produced countless
								blackbelts, many of whom went on to become top teachers and competitors
								themselves. A product of his era, John’s expertise did not stop at
								competition, and he is well known as a topflight, practical, real-world
								self-defense instructor. I cannot recommend John more highly."
